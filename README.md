# Order Block Detection System

A Python-based trading tool for detecting order blocks in cryptocurrency markets. The system supports both historical analysis with chart generation and live monitoring with Telegram notifications.

## Features

- **Multi-Symbol Support**: Configure multiple trading pairs to monitor simultaneously
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Run detection on 15m and 30m timeframes (configurable)
- **Historical Analysis**: Fetch historical data and generate charts showing detected order blocks
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time detection with parallel workers for each symbol/timeframe combination
- **Telegram Notifications**: Instant alerts when new order blocks are detected
- **Deduplication**: Smart tracking to avoid sending duplicate notifications

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RomanMatviiv/order_block.git
cd order_block
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables for Telegram notifications (optional):
```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id_here"
```

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to customize the symbols and timeframes to monitor:

```python
# List of symbols to process
SYMBOLS = [
    "BTC/USDT",
    "ETH/USDT",
    # Add more symbols here
]

# Timeframes to run the detector for
TIMEFRAMES = ["15m", "30m"]

# Live polling interval in seconds
POLL_INTERVAL_SEC = 30
```

### Adding New Symbols

To add new trading pairs, simply add them to the `SYMBOLS` list in `src/config.py`:

```python
SYMBOLS = [
    "BTC/USDT",
    "ETH/USDT",
    "BNB/USDT",
    "SOL/USDT",
    "ADA/USDT",
]
```

## Usage

### Historical Analysis

Run historical order block detection and generate charts:

```bash
python run_history.py
```

This will:
- Fetch 2 days of historical data for each configured symbol and timeframe
- Detect bullish and bearish order blocks
- Generate and save charts to the `charts/` directory
- Charts are named: `{symbol}_{timeframe}_order_blocks.png`

Example output:
```
============================================================
Order Block Historical Analysis
============================================================
Symbols: ['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT']
Timeframes: ['15m', '30m']

Processing BTC/USDT on 15m...
  Fetched 192 candles
  Detected 5 bullish and 3 bearish order blocks
  Chart saved to: charts/BTC_USDT_15m_order_blocks.png

Processing BTC/USDT on 30m...
  Fetched 96 candles
  Detected 3 bullish and 2 bearish order blocks
  Chart saved to: charts/BTC_USDT_30m_order_blocks.png
...
============================================================
Historical analysis complete!
============================================================
```

### Live Monitoring

The system offers two methods for live monitoring:

#### 1. WebSocket-Based Monitoring (Recommended)

Real-time monitoring using Binance WebSocket streams:

```bash
python run_live_ws.py
```

This will:
- Connect to Binance WebSocket for real-time kline updates
- Process only closed klines (no incomplete candle data)
- Maintain a rolling buffer of recent candles per symbol/timeframe
- Detect new order blocks immediately when candles close
- Send Telegram notifications for each new detection
- **Persist deduplication state to disk** (survives restarts)
- Automatically reconnect on connection failures

Example output:
```
============================================================
Order Block Live Monitoring (WebSocket)
============================================================
Symbols: ['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT']
Timeframes: ['15m', '30m']

Connecting to Binance WebSocket...
URL: wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams=btcusdt@kline_15m/btcusdt@kline_30m/ethusdt@kline_15m/ethusdt@kline_30m
Monitoring 2 symbols on 2 timeframes

‚úì Connected to Binance WebSocket
Listening for kline events... Press Ctrl+C to stop
============================================================

[BTC/USDT 15m] Buffering data... (25 candles)
[ETH/USDT 30m] Buffering data... (25 candles)

[BTC/USDT 15m] New bullish order block detected at index 150 (score: 0.73)
Telegram notification sent successfully

[ETH/USDT 30m] New bearish order block detected at index 85 (score: 0.68)
Telegram notification sent successfully
```

**Key advantages of WebSocket approach:**
- **Real-time updates**: Receives data as soon as candles close
- **Efficient**: No polling overhead, lower latency
- **Reliable**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Persistent deduplication**: State saved to `.dedup_state.json`
- **Restart-safe**: Won't resend old notifications after restarts

#### 2. Polling-Based Monitoring (Legacy)

Traditional polling method using REST API:

```bash
python run_live.py
```

This will:
- Start a separate worker thread for each symbol/timeframe combination
- Poll Binance every 30 seconds (configurable via `POLL_INTERVAL_SEC`)
- Detect new order blocks in real-time
- Send Telegram notifications for each new detection
- Keep track of notified blocks in memory (lost on restart)

Example output:
```
============================================================
Order Block Live Monitoring
============================================================
Symbols: ['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT']
Timeframes: ['15m', '30m']
Poll Interval: 30 seconds

Started 4 worker threads
Monitoring for order blocks... Press Ctrl+C to stop
============================================================

[BTC/USDT 15m] Worker started
[BTC/USDT 30m] Worker started
[ETH/USDT 15m] Worker started
[ETH/USDT 30m] Worker started

[BTC/USDT 15m] New bullish order block detected at index 150
Telegram notification sent successfully

[ETH/USDT 30m] New bearish order block detected at index 85
Telegram notification sent successfully
```

### Telegram Notification Format

Notifications include enhanced information:
- Symbol name (e.g., BTC/USDT)
- Timeframe (e.g., 15m)
- Block type (BULLISH or BEARISH)
- Price levels (low and high)
- Candle index
- **Confidence score (0-1) with star rating**
- **Number of touches**
- **Liquidity sweep indicator** (if detected)

Example notification:
```
üü¢ BULLISH Order Block Detected

Symbol: BTC/USDT
Timeframe: 15m
Block Low: 42150.50
Block High: 42350.75
Candle Index: 150

Confidence Score: 0.73 / 1.00
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH CONFIDENCE
Touches: 2
üî• Liquidity Sweep Detected!

Buy zone identified
```

**Confidence Score Ratings:**
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH CONFIDENCE: Score ‚â• 0.7
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê MEDIUM CONFIDENCE: Score ‚â• 0.5
- ‚≠ê LOW CONFIDENCE: Score < 0.5

## Order Block Detection Logic

The system uses an advanced order block detection algorithm with multiple validation layers:

### Detection Algorithm Features

1. **ATR-based Candle Filtering**
   - Candidate candles must have a sufficiently large body relative to ATR
   - Opposite-side wicks must be small to avoid false signals
   - Configurable via `BODY_MIN_RATIO` and `WICK_MAX_RATIO`

2. **Impulse Confirmation**
   - After the candidate candle, there must be a strong directional move
   - Validates both the number of directional candles and net price movement
   - Configurable via `DETECTION_LOOKAHEAD`, `IMPULSE_MIN_DIR_CANDLES`, and `IMPULSE_MIN_NET_MOVE`

3. **Multi-touch Validation**
   - Tracks how many times price returns to touch the zone
   - Higher touch counts indicate stronger zones
   - Configurable via `TOUCHES_REQUIRED` and `MAX_TOUCHES`

4. **Liquidity Sweep Detection (Optional)**
   - Identifies stop-hunts: quick wick extensions followed by reversals
   - Zones with liquidity sweeps receive higher confidence scores
   - Marked with special highlighting in charts and notifications

5. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Composite score (0-1) based on multiple factors:
     - Candle body size relative to ATR (20% weight)
     - Impulse strength (30% weight)
     - Number of touches (20% weight)
     - Volume spike (15% weight)
     - Liquidity sweep detection (15% weight)
   - Zones are displayed with shading intensity based on score

6. **Zone Management**
   - Overlapping zones are automatically merged
   - Zones expire after a configurable number of bars
   - Configurable via `ZONE_EXPIRY_BARS` and `ZONE_MERGE_THRESHOLD`

### Block Types

**Bullish Order Block:**
- A down candle (close < open) with substantial body
- Small upper wick (opposite side)
- Followed by strong upward impulse
- Represents a potential support zone where buyers stepped in

**Bearish Order Block:**
- An up candle (close > open) with substantial body
- Small lower wick (opposite side)
- Followed by strong downward impulse
- Represents a potential resistance zone where sellers stepped in

### Detection Parameters

You can tune the detection algorithm by editing these parameters in `src/config.py`:

```python
# ATR settings
ATR_PERIOD = 14              # ATR calculation period
ATR_MULT = 1.0              # ATR multiplier for thresholds

# Candle filters
BODY_MIN_RATIO = 0.5        # Min body size as ratio of ATR (0.5 = 50%)
WICK_MAX_RATIO = 0.3        # Max opposite wick as ratio of body (0.3 = 30%)

# Impulse confirmation
DETECTION_LOOKAHEAD = 10    # Bars to check for impulse
IMPULSE_MIN_DIR_CANDLES = 6 # Min directional candles required
IMPULSE_MIN_NET_MOVE = 1.5  # Min net movement as multiple of ATR

# Touch validation
TOUCHES_REQUIRED = 1        # Min touches for validation (1 = initial)
MAX_TOUCHES = 5             # Max touches before zone exhaustion

# Zone management
ZONE_EXPIRY_BARS = 100     # Bars until zone expires
ZONE_MERGE_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Overlap % for merging zones

# Volume and liquidity
MIN_VOLUME_SPIKE_MULT = 1.5    # Min volume spike multiplier
LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_WICK_RATIO = 0.6  # Wick ratio for sweep detection
LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL_BARS = 3 # Bars to check for reversal

# Scoring weights (must sum to 1.0)
SCORE_WEIGHT_BODY_SIZE = 0.20
SCORE_WEIGHT_IMPULSE = 0.30
SCORE_WEIGHT_TOUCHES = 0.20
SCORE_WEIGHT_VOLUME = 0.15
SCORE_WEIGHT_LIQUIDITY_SWEEP = 0.15
```

### Tuning Tips

- **Increase `BODY_MIN_RATIO`** to detect only stronger candles (more selective)
- **Decrease `WICK_MAX_RATIO`** to filter out candles with large wicks (cleaner signals)
- **Increase `IMPULSE_MIN_DIR_CANDLES`** to require stronger impulse moves (fewer but higher quality)
- **Increase `TOUCHES_REQUIRED`** to wait for price confirmation (more reliable but delayed)
- **Adjust `ZONE_EXPIRY_BARS`** based on your timeframe (longer for higher timeframes)
- **Adjust scoring weights** to emphasize factors most important for your strategy

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- ccxt (for Binance API integration)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib (for chart generation)
- requests (for Telegram API)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

## Troubleshooting

### Telegram Notifications Not Working

Make sure you have set the environment variables:
```bash
echo $TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
echo $TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
```

If not set, the system will print warnings but continue to operate without sending notifications.

### Charts Not Generated

Ensure the `charts/` directory exists and has write permissions. The system creates it automatically if it doesn't exist.

### Connection Errors

If you encounter connection errors to Binance:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify that Binance is not blocked in your region
- The ccxt library has built-in rate limiting to avoid API bans
